Week 1 – Foundational Python Implementations

Aim of the Challenge:
To build a foundational understanding of algorithmic thinking using Python, and later to consider which of these algorithms could benefit from hardware acceleration.

Problems I Faced:
- Initially struggled with understanding the real computational cost of Python bytecode operations.
- Had difficulty comparing performance across algorithms because I didn’t normalize input sizes or track time in a standardized way.

Final Outcome:
- Implemented matrix_mult.py, crypto.py, quicks.py, and count_bytecode.py.
- Gained baseline knowledge of algorithm design patterns and performance implications.

What I Learned:
- Bytecode can be used to estimate the operations involved behind high-level Python code.
- Algorithmic patterns like matrix multiplication are good candidates for acceleration.

How to Run:
python matrix_mult.py
python crypto.py
python quicks.py
