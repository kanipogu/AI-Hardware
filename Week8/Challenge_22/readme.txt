Week 8 â€“ Challenge 22

Aim:
To complete a full synthesis and implementation flow of a designed hardware block, likely including simulation and constraint verification.

Problems I Faced:
- Required tool setup (Vivado/Yosys) was complex and error-prone.
- Encountered missing constraint issues that caused failed timing checks.
- Needed to generate waveforms and synthesis summaries.

Final Outcome:
- Submitted synthesis report and timing data in Challenge_22.pdf.
- Demonstrated resource utilization and constraints.

What I Learned:
- Synthesis requires both logic design and constraint management.
- Resource mapping, timing, and tool compatibility are all important.
- Understanding what tools expect is crucial for successful builds.
