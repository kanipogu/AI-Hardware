Week 5 â€“ Challenge 17

Aim:
To simulate a systolic array architecture for bubble sort and visualize the performance gain of structured data flow.

Problems I Faced:
- Translating sequential bubble sort to a systolic architecture was not intuitive.
- Needed to enforce time-step-based coordination between elements.
- Initially lacked performance logging.

Final Outcome:
- Implemented bubble sort simulation using systolic design principles in challenge_17.py.
- Plotted performance comparisons (performance.png, performance_comp.png).
- Documented the pipeline in Challenge17_SystolicArrayBubbleSort_Report.pdf.

What I Learned:
- Systolic arrays are valuable for predictable, repetitive data operations.
- Even inefficient algorithms can be accelerated with correct data structuring.
- Bubble sort was useful as a demonstrative exercise.

How to Run:
python challenge_17.py
