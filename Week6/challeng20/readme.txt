Week 6 â€“ Challenge 20

Aim:
To implement and simulate a dynamic crossbar switch system and analyze assignment efficiency and throughput.

Problems I Faced:
- Needed to understand dynamic scheduling and contention handling.
- Visualizing crossbar state was difficult without custom output.
- Assignment algorithm had initial logic flaws.

Final Outcome:
- Completed crossbar model and captured results in Challenge20_Crossbar_Assignment_Report.pdf.
- Simulated the system and reviewed Simulation Results.pdf.

What I Learned:
- Crossbars are core to communication-centric architectures (e.g., NoC).
- The efficiency of resource assignment strongly affects performance.
- Scheduling and blocking models can impact overall latency.
