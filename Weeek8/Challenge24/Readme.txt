Challenge #24 – EBRAINS BrainScaleS-2 Simulation
Student: Balu Anudeep Kanipogu
Course: ECE 410/510 – Spring 2025

What I Have Done:

• Logged into the EBRAINS Collaboratory platform using the provided NMC test collab link.
• Accessed the Lab interface through the Jülich Supercomputing Center (JSC).
• Navigated to the BrainScaleS > brainscales2-demos folder and opened the 'tp_00-introduction.ipynb' notebook.
• Switched the kernel to 'EBRAINS-experimental' as required.
• Executed the tutorial which simulates excitatory and inhibitory spike inputs to an integrator neuron.
• Plotted membrane voltage and recorded neuron spikes using PyNN on BrainScaleS-2 hardware.
• Encountered a server error while exporting the notebook as PDF. Resolved it by planning to use HTML export instead.
• Documented results with screenshots and plan to upload them with the notebook.


What I Have Learned:

• Understood how to interact with EBRAINS’ neuromorphic computing platform and launch simulations using the Lab interface.
• Learned how to configure and stimulate neural populations using the PyNN library.
• Observed how excitatory and inhibitory inputs affect neuron firing and membrane voltage dynamics.
• Learned how to switch kernels, run Jupyter notebooks, and deal with common errors in JupyterHub (e.g., nbconvert issues).
• Practiced extracting and interpreting spike activity from BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic hardware in a tutorial setting.
