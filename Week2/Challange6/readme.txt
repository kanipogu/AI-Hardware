Week 2 â€“ Challenge 6

Aim:
To simulate decision logic in Python and explore how such logic could later be translated into hardware.

Problems I Faced:
- Initially had no visualization to validate logic flow.
- Logic was only tested on static data instead of streamed inputs.

Final Outcome:
- Wrote decision code in Challenge_6_1.py, processed input/output interactions.
- Could visualize intermediate results using logs.

What I Learned:
- This logic can easily be implemented using a Verilog FSM or LUT-based structure.
- Decision trees are better understood when visualized.

How to Run:
python Challenge_6_1.py
