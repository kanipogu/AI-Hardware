Week 2 – Challenge 7

Aim:
To understand how classifiers work and how they form decision boundaries in feature space.

Problems:
- Lacked training feedback in early iterations.
- Didn’t visualize decision boundary interactively, relied only on final static image.

Final Outcome:
- Trained a basic classifier 
- Generated decision_boundary.png.

What I Learned:
- Visualizing model performance (especially in 2D) is powerful.
- Reinforced that not all problems are linearly separable.
